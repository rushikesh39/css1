        what is CSS?
    </h2>
    <ol class="">
        <li>Css stands for Cascading Style sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li>
        <li>
            <p id="para1"> CSS is not neccesary</p>
            <p id="para2"> CSS saves a lot of work.</p> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        </li>
        <li id="list4">External stylesheets are stored in css files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="second-heading">
        Css can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:
    </h2>
    <ul id="ul1">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external Css file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add css, is to keep the styles in external css files. <span class="span1"> Howere, in
                this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and
            easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.Id,on the
        other hand, applies style to one unique element.Id is also special in that you can use a special Url to link
        direct element and it's used by javascript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page.Once an element has
        been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to
        target elements to which a style should be applied.
